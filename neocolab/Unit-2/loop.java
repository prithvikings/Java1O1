Problem Statement



Ted, the computer science enthusiast, has accepted the challenge of writing a program that checks if the number of digits in an integer matches the sum of its digits.



Guide Ted in designing and writing the code to solve this problem using a 'do-while' loop. 

Input format :
The input consists of an integer N, representing the number to be checked.

Output format :
If the sum is equal to the number of digits, print "The number of digits in N matches the sum of its digits."

Else, print "The number of digits in N does not match the sum of its digits."



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 106

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
20
Output 1 :
The number of digits in 20 matches the sum of its digits.
Input 2 :
34
Output 2 :
The number of digits in 34 does not match the sum of its digits.

Understanding the Problem Statement
You take an integer ùëÅ
N as input.
Count how many digits the number has.
Compute the sum of all its digits.
Compare the count of digits with the sum of digits.
Print a message based on whether they are equal or not. */

question 2
Problem Statement



In a coding competition, you are tasked with a unique problem. You need to write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of the odd digits in a given integer. 

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer N, representing the number whose odd digits will be squared and summed.

Output format :
The output prints an integer, representing the sum of the squares of the odd digits in the given integer.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 106

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
12345
Output 1 :
35
Input 2 :
2085
Output 2 :
25
Input 3 :
2468
Output 3 :
0

 //Aproach
 //1. Take an integer N as input.
//2. Initialize a variable sum to store the sum of squares of odd digits.
//3. Iterate over each digit of the number N.
//4. Check if the digit is odd.
//5. If the digit is odd, square it and add it to the sum.
//6. Print the sum as the output.

//Another Approach
 //1. Take an integer N as input.
//2. Initialize a variable sum to store the sum of squares of odd digits.
//3. extract last digit of N
//4. Check if the digit is odd.
//5. If the digit is odd, square it and add it to the sum.
//6. Print the sum as the output.
