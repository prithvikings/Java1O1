//Polymorphis: Poly means many and morph means same thing or duplicate

//Basic meaning of polymorphism is when we try to achieve the same thing or when we try to do similar things in multiple forms.

//Their are two type of polymoriphism:
//1.Compile time polymorphism it is static here we do method overloading

//2. Run time Polymorphism it is dynamic here we do method overriding.


//Method overloading: Multiple functions with same name but different parameters.

//Method overriding: When we have a method in parent class and same method in child class with same name and same parameters. Basically parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different defination.
