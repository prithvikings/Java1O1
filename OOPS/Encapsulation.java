//Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.

//Encapsulation can be achieved by:
//1. Using private access modifier
//2. Using public methods

//Encapsulation is used to:
//1. Control the access to the data members of a class
//2. Prevent the data from being modified by mistake
//3. Make the class more flexible and maintainable
//4. Improve the security of the data

//Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data & method under a single unit. It also implement the data hiding concept. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing

//it is basically a capsule of data and method mtlb humne ek class bana ke waha pe humne apne properties and function ko define kar diya hai.
